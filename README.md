# Build Complex Express Sites with Redis and Socket.io [Video]
This is the code repository for [Build Complex Express Sites with Redis and Socket.io [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/build-complex-express-sites-redis-and-socketio-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468772), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video course shows you how to use Node.js to build websites, and focuses primarily on Express as the framework that the website will be built in. In addition to Express, we cover the use of Redis and Socket.io to make more robust and dynamic sites. Many courses only focus on one of these, but this course covers all of them.By the end of this course, you will be able to build applications using Express, Redis, and Socket.io. Express helps by making full-featured web applications easy if you know how. Redis opens doors by making data quick and easy to fetch. Many sites have used Redis to make difficult data problems easy. Lastly, Socket.io makes two-way communication between the browser and web application easy. If you have ever needed to build something that was real-time, then Socket.io is what you want to use.
